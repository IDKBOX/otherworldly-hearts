  - A Human.....
  - How peculiar...
  - It's been a very long time since I've seen another human
  - The last human abandoned me in this place...
  - Tell me human... what's your purpose of coming here?
  - .....
  - You're coming here to exorcise me?
  - HAHAHAHAHAHA
  - Many people have tried, but they're all liars...
  - I am curious though, if you're able to exorcise me
  - I'll follow you on your journey
