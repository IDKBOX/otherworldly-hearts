  - "My dear child, It seems like I\u2019ve gotten very ill"
  - "I\u2019m sorry for being such a horrible father..."
  - I thought by bringing you back, it will finally give me another chance to redeem

  - "But alas... i\u2019m succumbing to the same disease that you had..."
  - "My dear child... I\u2019m sorry... "
  - "I couldn\u2019t always be there for you"
  - "I couldn\u2019t be a proper father. I couldn\u2019t stand seeing you dying..."
  - 'I have to send you back to the spirit realm now... '
  - "Otherwise you\u2019ll be stuck here forever..."
