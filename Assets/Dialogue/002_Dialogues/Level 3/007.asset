  - That diary...
  - "It\u2019s talking about me isn\u2019t it...?"
  - "So i was once the shaman\u2019s daughter...?"
  - .......
  - Now that I think about it...
  - "My memories are slowly coming back to me...\LI\u2019ve been living with my father
    ever since I was a small girl"
  - But he was always busy with something...
  - He never told me about his work, But strange people used to come and visit our
    house...
  - One day I felt sick... very sick...
  - It was odd.. no medicine can cure it... even the famous doctor gave up...
  - It felt very painful... until suddenly, I woke up in this house as if nothing
    had happened...
  - "I don\u2019t know what happened though... I can\u2019t remember anything about
    it..."
  - ......
  - In the end, looks like he actually cared about me But it was all to late...
  - ......
  - Thank you father...
  - ......
  - 'Human.... '
  - "Let\u2019s continue..... "
  - Sorry for telling you all that...
